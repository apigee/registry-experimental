# Registry Experiments

The [Apigee Registry API](https://github.com/apigee/registry) allows teams
to upload and share machine-readable descriptions of APIs that are in use
and development.

This repository holds experimental code that builds on the Registry API: new
projects, suspended projects, and work that might be useful in future projects.
