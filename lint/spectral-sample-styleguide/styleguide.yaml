          documents from third parties and using the parsed content rendered in HTML/JS.

          third parties does something shady like inject <script> tags, they could easily
          execute arbitrary code on your domain, which if it's the same as your main

          tooling will not. Avoid any confusion by just documenting them without the slash,
          and maybe some tooling will let people shove a / on there when they're using it
          or maybe not, but at least the docs are suggesting how it should be done properly.
