# Apigee API hub

The [Apigee API hub](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-hub) is a hosted
service that allows organizations to build a consolidated directory of
information about all of the APIs at all stages of their lifecycles, from
design and implementation through deprecation and retirement. It includes and
builds on a hosted instance of the
[API Registry API](https://github.com/apigee/registry).

The Apigee API hub is currently available in public preview. It can be
provisioned using steps described at
[cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-hub/get-started-api-hub](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-hub/get-started-api-hub)
and automated using the [provision-apihub.sh](/apihub/provision-apihub.sh)
script in this directory.
